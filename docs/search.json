Consequently, the nature of planning should be conceived on the long term dimension as well.\n\n\nTherefore, ensuring Africa does not miss the opportunity of maximizing its demographic dividends requires designing and implementing highly effective medium- and long-term development plans. These plans must be closely monitored and adjusted as contexts and forecasts change. The challenge is significant, and time is short. So, where to start?\n\n\nOne policy priority stands out: Domestic Resources Mobilization (DRM). Significantly improving the state’s ability to rely on predictable financial flows is crucial for supporting development sustainability with sustainable finances (Duarte, Cristina 2020).\n\n\nThis does not contradict the imperative of focusing on women and youth; rather, it complements it. Maintaining policy focus on these groups may hold unparalleled potential for long-term benefits.

The Q-Q plots allow us to visually assess the normality of the numeric variables. Deviations from the diagonal line suggest that the data may not be normally distributed, which could impact parametric statistical analyses.\n\n\n$`0`\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDensity plot (Univariate)\nDensity plots provide a smoothed estimate of the data distribution, allowing for easy visualization of the distribution shape and comparison between different variables.\nDensity plots show the distribution of each numeric variable. Peaks in the density plots indicate modes, and the spread indicates variability. These plots help in understanding the distribution and identifying any potential skewness or multimodality.\n\n\n$`0`\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScatter plot (Bivariate)\nScatter plots are used to explore the relationship between pairs of numeric variables, helping in identifying potential correlations or patterns.
